    <p style="padding-bottom:20px;"> REFUNDS</p>
    <p style="padding-bottom:20px;"> Claims for returns or cancellations are sent by mail. In the claim the customer states the reason for the claim. We reserve the right not to accept the claim of the buyer, if the grounds for his/her complaint are found to be unreasonable. The returned product must be in the same condition in which you received it (as new), without being unsealed or the package being violated, just before the sale, as the full original packaging. To accept the return, you must show the order number of the person who originally purchased the product and whose details are shown in the order code.</p>

    <p style="padding-bottom:20px;"> The customer has the right to return the product purchased and ask to be replaced with another product or a refund, in two cases:</p>

    <p style="padding-bottom:20px;"> 1. In cases of proven fault of our company (received wrong product or product with quality defects), the customer should return the product within ten (10) days from the day he/she received it, at no cost transport.</p>

    <p style="padding-bottom:20px;"> 2. If the customer's decision to return the product did not result from any of the aforesaid objective reasons, the company reserves the right not to honor the claim. If the complaint is upheld, the customer can return the product within ten (10) days from the date of receipt. In this case all transport costs as well as any difference in the price of products shall be borne by the customer.</p>

    <p style="padding-bottom:20px;"> In all cases, the products should be in the condition received by the customer, complete, without any damage and in their original packaging. If not returned within ten (10) days, then our shop is not obliged to accept any refund. Upon compliance with the Terms and conditions and the acceptance of the return of the product, the customer is entitled to receive either another product of equal value or a refund. The refund to the customer will be completed within ninety (90) days from the date we receive the product. In case of repeated refunds or refunds in the event that our company in its sole discretion, deems that the customer is abusing the right of return or act in bad faith is entitled to refuse to return the product, even if these conditions are met and fulfilled. These terms shall not affect any consumer rights provided by law.</p>
